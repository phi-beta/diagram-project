# Cloned Node Edge Creation Fix - Summary

## Problem
After cloning a node and trying to enter edge creation mode on the cloned node, the system would throw an error:
```
edgeStartNode does not have getGlobalCenter or getTransformedCenter method
```

## Root Cause
The issue was that when a node was cloned, the cloned node instance was missing the required `coordinateSystem` and `dragManager` dependencies. These dependencies were being set later in the `makeDraggable` method, but the state machine initialization and edge creation logic needed them immediately.

## Solution
Modified the `clone` method in `Node.js` to accept `coordinateSystem` and `dragManager` parameters and set them immediately after creating the cloned node, before state machine initialization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `Node.js` (v063 → v064)
- Modified the `clone` method to accept optional `coordinateSystem` and `dragManager` parameters
- Added logic to copy these dependencies from the original node if not explicitly provided
- Set these dependencies on the cloned node before state machine initialization

```javascript
// Before:
async clone(svg) {
  // ... clone logic ...
  const clonedNode = new Node(duplicatedNodeData.toData(), g);
  // ... state machine initialization ...
  return clonedNode;
}

// After:
async clone(svg, coordinateSystem = null, dragManager = null) {
  // ... clone logic ...
  const clonedNode = new Node(duplicatedNodeData.toData(), g);
  
  // Copy external dependencies from original node if not explicitly provided
  if (coordinateSystem || this.coordinateSystem) {
    clonedNode.coordinateSystem = coordinateSystem || this.coordinateSystem;
  }
  if (dragManager || this.dragManager) {
    clonedNode.dragManager = dragManager || this.dragManager;
  }
  
  // ... state machine initialization ...
  return clonedNode;
}
```

### 2. Updated `renderer.js` (v095 → v096)
- Modified the cloning call to pass the required dependencies:

```javascript
// Before:
const clonedNode = await nodeToClone.clone(svg);

// After:
const clonedNode = await nodeToClone.clone(svg, viewBoxManager.coordinateSystem, dragManager);
```

### 3. Updated version references
- Updated `index.html` to use renderer.js v096
- Updated import versions for cache busting

## Testing
- Created a specific test page: `test-cloned-node-edge-creation.html`
- Created a programmatic test script: `test-clone-fix.js`
- Verified that cloned nodes can successfully:
  - Be selected (turn blue)
  - Enter edge creation mode (Shift + click)
  - Display temporary edges (orange dashed line)
  - Complete edge creation by clicking on target nodes
  - Cancel edge creation with Escape key

## Status: ✅ FIXED
The issue is now resolved. Cloned nodes have all the required methods and dependencies to participate in edge creation, just like the original nodes.

## Files Modified
- `js/Node.js` - Updated clone method to accept and set dependencies
- `js/renderer.js` - Updated clone call to pass dependencies
- `index.html` - Updated version reference
- `test-cloned-node-edge-creation.html` - Created test page
- `test-clone-fix.js` - Created validation script

The fix ensures that cloned nodes are fully functional and have the same capabilities as original nodes, including edge creation functionality.
