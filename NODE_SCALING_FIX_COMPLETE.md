# Node Scaling Fix - Complete Solution

## Issue Identified
The node scaling functionality was using inconsistent and outdated center calculation methods to determine the mouse distance from the node center. This caused:

1. **Incorrect scaling behavior** - Scaling was relative to unscaled node centers rather than actual visible centers
2. **Inconsistent mouse responsiveness** - Mouse distance calculations were based on wrong center positions
3. **Pan/zoom instability** - Scaling behavior would break when the viewport was transformed

## Root Cause Analysis
The scaling logic in multiple locations was using old center calculation methods:

### 1. `legacyMouseDown()` method (lines 556-559)
```javascript
// Before (incorrect):
const center = this.coordinateSystem 
  ? this.coordinateSystem.getNodeCenter(this.element, 'global')
  : this.getGlobalCenter();
```

### 2. Initial scaling setup (lines 577-580)
```javascript
// Before (incorrect):
const scalingCenter = this.coordinateSystem 
  ? this.coordinateSystem.getNodeCenter(this.element, 'global')
  : this.getGlobalCenter();
```

### 3. State machine initialization (lines 619-622)
```javascript
// Before (incorrect):
const center = this.coordinateSystem 
  ? this.coordinateSystem.getNodeCenter(this.element, 'global')
  : this.getGlobalCenter();
```

### 4. Mode transition handling (lines 663-665)
```javascript
// Before (incorrect):
const center = this.coordinateSystem 
  ? this.coordinateSystem.getNodeCenter(this.element, 'global')
  : this.getGlobalCenter();
```

### 5. General mouse down handler (lines 461-465)
```javascript
// Before (incorrect):
const center = this.coordinateSystem 
  ? this.coordinateSystem.getNodeCenter(this.element, 'global')
  : this.getGlobalCenter();
```

## Solution Applied

### Consistent Center Calculation
All scaling-related center calculations now use the same method as permanent edges and other operations:

```javascript
// After (correct):
const center = this.getViewportCenter();
```

### Key Changes Made

1. **legacyMouseDown()** - Updated to use `getViewportCenter()`
2. **Scaling initialization** - Updated to use `getViewportCenter()`
3. **State machine scaling** - Updated to use `getViewportCenter()`
4. **Mode transitions** - Updated to use `getViewportCenter()`
5. **General mouse handling** - Updated to use `getViewportCenter()`

### Benefits of the Fix

1. **Consistent Method Usage**
   - All scaling operations now use the same center calculation as edges and other features
   - Eliminates discrepancies between different parts of the system

2. **Proper Scaling Behavior**
   - Mouse distance is calculated from the actual visible center of scaled nodes
   - Scaling feels natural and responsive to mouse movement
   - Works correctly with nodes of different initial scales

3. **Viewport Stability**
   - Scaling behavior remains consistent during pan/zoom operations
   - No jumping or unexpected behavior when viewport transforms

4. **Accurate Distance Calculations**
   - `startDistance` and `currentDistance` are based on correct center positions
   - Scale factors are calculated relative to the actual visual appearance

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- Scaling used unscaled center positions (often far from visible centers)
- Mouse distance calculations were incorrect for scaled nodes
- Scaling behavior was inconsistent with visual appearance
- Pan/zoom could break scaling responsiveness

### After Fix:
- Scaling uses actual visible center positions
- Mouse distance calculations are accurate and responsive
- Scaling behavior matches visual expectations
- Pan/zoom maintains consistent scaling behavior

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Initialize test** - Create nodes with different scales
2. **Select a node** - Click to select (should turn blue)
3. **Test scaling** - Hold Shift and drag to scale
4. **Verify behavior** - Scaling should be relative to visible center
5. **Test pan/zoom** - Try scaling while viewport is transformed

### Test File Created:
- **test-node-scaling-fix.html** - Interactive test with nodes of different scales
- **Index.html** - Main application should show improved scaling behavior

## Files Modified
- **js/Node.js** - Fixed all center calculation methods in scaling logic

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Node scaling now uses consistent, accurate center calculations that match the visual appearance of scaled nodes. Scaling behavior is now:
- Responsive to actual mouse distance from visible centers
- Consistent across all scaling operations
- Stable during pan/zoom operations
- Accurate for nodes of any initial scale

The scaling glitch has been resolved and should now provide intuitive, accurate scaling behavior that matches user expectations.
