# GRID LEVEL FIX SUMMARY

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Grid Level Range Too Narrow
**Problem**: Only searching levels -10 to 20, missing intermediate levels
**Fix**: Expanded to -20 to 30 for broader coverage

### 2. Grid Multiplier Too Large  
**Problem**: gridMultiplier = 5 created huge gaps between levels
**Fix**: Reduced to 2.5 for more intermediate grid levels

### 3. Spacing Filters Too Restrictive
**Problem**: minSpacing = 5px, maxSpacing = 200px filtered out too many levels
**Fix**: Relaxed to minSpacing = 3px, maxSpacing = 400px

### 4. Opacity Calculation Not Granular Enough
**Problem**: Dramatic opacity mapping caused only 2 distinct values (0.60, 0.05)
**Fix**: Replaced with spacing-based opacity ranges that vary smoothly

## Expected Results

After these changes, you should see:

1. **More Grid Levels**: Instead of just 2 levels (L0, L1), you should see 3-4 levels active
2. **Varied Opacity Values**: Each level should show different opacity values like 0.15, 0.40, 0.75, 0.90
3. **Dynamic Level Changes**: As zoom changes, different levels should appear/disappear
4. **Responsive Opacity**: Opacity should change visibly as zoom level changes

## Debug Output to Watch For

In the browser console, look for:
- `🔍 Found X potential levels` (X should be > 2)
- `📊 Selected Y grid levels` with varied level numbers
- `📊 Dynamic opacity updated` with different opacity values for each level
- Level debug showing calculations for levels -5 to 5

## Testing Instructions

1. Refresh the debug page to load the updated GridManager
2. Open browser console to see debug output
3. Use zoom slider to test different zoom levels
4. Watch for varied grid levels and opacity values in both console and visual display
