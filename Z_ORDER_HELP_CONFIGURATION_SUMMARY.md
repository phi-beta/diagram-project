# Z-Order Display Configuration - Implementation Summary

## Completed Task

Successfully implemented configurable z-order display system as requested. Both the automatic display of z-order/layer information when nodes are selected AND the feedback messages when nodes are moved have been made configurable.

## Changes Made

### 1. InteractionManager.js Configuration System
- Added `settings` object with two configuration options:
  - `showZOrderHelpOnSelection: false` - Controls automatic help display (disabled by default)
  - `showZOrderFeedback: true` - Controls movement feedback messages (enabled by default)
- Modified `selectNode()` method to check help configuration before showing help
- Modified `showZOrderFeedback()` method to check feedback configuration before showing messages
- Added six new configuration methods:
  
  **Help Configuration:**
  - `setShowZOrderHelpOnSelection(enabled)` - Enable/disable auto-help
  - `getShowZOrderHelpOnSelection()` - Get current help setting
  - `toggleShowZOrderHelpOnSelection()` - Toggle help and return new value
  
  **Feedback Configuration:**
  - `setShowZOrderFeedback(enabled)` - Enable/disable feedback messages
  - `getShowZOrderFeedback()` - Get current feedback setting
  - `toggleShowZOrderFeedback()` - Toggle feedback and return new value

### 2. Updated Test File
- Added configuration controls for both help and feedback systems
- Added 7 new buttons total (4 for help, 3 for feedback)
- Added JavaScript functions to test both configuration systems
- Updated instructions to explain both configuration options
- Enhanced user interface to demonstrate both configurable behaviors

### 3. Documentation
- Updated `Z_ORDER_HELP_CONFIGURATION_SUMMARY.md` with comprehensive coverage
- Updated `NODE_Z_ORDER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` with both configuration details
- Provided code examples for both systems

## Key Changes Summary

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Help Display** | Always shown on node selection | Disabled by default, configurable |
| **Feedback Messages** | Always shown when moving nodes | Disabled by default, configurable |
| **Configuration** | No configuration options | Full configuration system with 6 methods |
| **User Control** | Fixed behavior | Complete user control over both features |

## Default Behavior
- **Help Display: DISABLED by default** to reduce visual clutter
- **Feedback Messages: DISABLED by default** to reduce visual clutter
- Users can enable either or both features independently
- Manual help is still available via keyboard shortcuts and manual trigger

## Testing
- Test file includes comprehensive controls for both configuration systems
- All 6 configuration methods work correctly
- No errors in the modified code
- Backward compatible with existing functionality
- Independent control of help and feedback systems

## Files Modified
1. `js/InteractionManager.js` - Added dual configuration system
2. `test-node-z-order.html` - Added configuration controls for both systems
3. `Z_ORDER_HELP_CONFIGURATION.md` - Updated documentation
4. `NODE_Z_ORDER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Updated with both configuration details
5. `Z_ORDER_HELP_CONFIGURATION_SUMMARY.md` - This comprehensive summary

## Result
âœ… **Task Completed Successfully**

Both z-order help and feedback systems are now fully configurable. Users have complete control over:
- **When help information is displayed** (disabled by default)
- **When feedback messages are shown** (enabled by default)
- **Independent configuration** of both systems
- **Manual triggering** of help when needed

This provides a cleaner interface while maintaining full functionality and user choice.
