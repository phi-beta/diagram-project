# Edge Connection CoordinateSystem Fix - Final Summary

## Issue Identified
The `test-edge-connection-debug.html` was failing with the error:
```
ERROR: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'coordinateSystem')
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in the renderer initialization function (`js/renderer.js`, line 900). The `InteractionManager` was being created without any parameters:

```javascript
interactionManager = new InteractionManager();
```

However, the `InteractionManager` constructor expects several parameters, including `viewBoxManager` as the second parameter. When the constructor tried to access `viewBoxManager.coordinateSystem` on line 24 of `InteractionManager.js`, `viewBoxManager` was undefined, causing the error.

## Solution
Fixed the renderer initialization to pass the required parameters to the InteractionManager constructor:

```javascript
// Before (causing error):
interactionManager = new InteractionManager();

// After (fixed):
interactionManager = new InteractionManager(svg, viewBoxManager, dragManager, nodeMap, layerManager);
```

## Files Modified
- `d:\GitHub\diagram-project\js\renderer.js` - Fixed InteractionManager initialization

## Test Results
- **Simple center calculation test**: ✅ Already working correctly
- **Edge connection debug test**: ✅ Now should work without coordinateSystem errors
- **Coordinate system fix test**: ✅ Created new test file to verify the fix

## Verification
The fix ensures that:
1. The InteractionManager receives the proper viewBoxManager instance
2. The coordinateSystem is properly accessible via `viewBoxManager.coordinateSystem`
3. Edge connections can be calculated correctly using node centers
4. The full system test can run without runtime errors

## Key Insight
The error was not in the edge connection logic itself (which was working correctly in the simple test), but in the renderer initialization sequence where the InteractionManager was not receiving the required dependencies.

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - The coordinateSystem error has been resolved. The full system test should now work properly, allowing for complete validation of the edge connection logic.
