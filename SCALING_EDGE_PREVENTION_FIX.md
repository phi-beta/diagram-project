# Scaling Mode Edge Prevention and Temporary Edge Cleanup Fix

## Issue Description
Two related issues were identified with edge creation behavior:

1. **Scaling Edge Prevention**: When scaling a node, temporary edges could begin to be displayed as the mouse moves outside of the range of the node's new size. This was undesirable behavior - temporary edges should not be created while a node is actively being scaled.

2. **Temporary Edge Sticking**: After scaling a node, when the user releases the mouse button but keeps holding Shift, then drags the mouse away from the node to create a temporary edge, clicking on the background would cause the temporary edge to "stick" and remain visible until another temporary edge is started or the Escape key is pressed.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Scaling Edge Prevention
The edge creation logic in both `InteractionManager` and `DiagramStateManager` was not properly checking if a node was currently in scaling mode (`isScaling = true`) before starting edge creation.

### Issue 2: Temporary Edge Sticking
The DiagramStateManager's `removeTemporaryEdge` method was only removing its own `this.temporaryEdge` reference, but temporary edges were actually created and managed by the InteractionManager. The DiagramStateManager wasn't properly delegating the cleanup to the InteractionManager, causing temporary edges to remain in the DOM even after background clicks.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. InteractionManager Fix (Issue 1)
**File**: `js/InteractionManager.js`
- **Existing Check**: The InteractionManager already had a proper check in the `handleMouseMove` method:
```javascript
// Don't start edge creation if the selected node is currently being scaled
if (this.selectedNode.isScaling) {
  console.log(`üö´ SKIPPING EDGE CREATION: Node ${this.selectedNode.id} is currently being scaled`);
  return;
}
```

### 2. DiagramStateManager Fix (Issue 1)
**File**: `js/DiagramStateManager.js`
- **Added Check**: Added a scaling prevention check in the `startEdgeCreation` method:
```javascript
// Check if the source node is currently being scaled
if (sourceNode && sourceNode.isScaling) {
  console.log(`üö´ SKIPPING EDGE CREATION: Source node ${sourceNode.id} is currently being scaled`);
  debugEdgeCreation(`üö´ Blocked edge creation - source node is scaling`);
  return false;
}
```

### 3. DiagramStateManager Cleanup Fix (Issue 2)
**File**: `js/DiagramStateManager.js`
- **Enhanced Cleanup**: Updated the `removeTemporaryEdge` method to properly delegate to InteractionManager:
```javascript
removeTemporaryEdge() {
  debugEdgeCreation('üîß removeTemporaryEdge called');
  
  // Remove DiagramStateManager's temporary edge if it exists
  if (this.temporaryEdge) {
    debugEdgeCreation('üóëÔ∏è Removing DiagramStateManager temporary edge');
    this.temporaryEdge.remove();
    this.temporaryEdge = null;
    debugEdgeCreation('‚úÖ DiagramStateManager temporary edge removed');
  }
  
  // Also delegate to InteractionManager to remove its temporary edge
  if (this.interactionManager && typeof this.interactionManager.cleanupLocalEdgeState === 'function') {
    debugEdgeCreation('üóëÔ∏è Delegating temporary edge cleanup to InteractionManager');
    this.interactionManager.cleanupLocalEdgeState();
  }
  
  debugEdgeCreation('‚úÖ Temporary edge cleanup completed');
}
```

### 4. State Machine Configuration Fix (Issue 1)
**File**: `config/diagram-state-machine.json`
- **Updated Conditions**: Added `!sourceNode.isScaling` condition to prevent edge creation when node is scaling:
```json
{
  "state": "idle",
  "condition": "shiftKeyDown && mouseMovedAwayFromNode && !sourceNode.isScaling",
  "action": "startEdgeCreation"
},
{
  "state": "idle", 
  "condition": "shiftKeyDown && clickedDifferentNode && !sourceNode.isScaling",
  "action": "startEdgeCreation"
}
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Node Scaling State Management
- The `Node.js` class maintains an `isScaling` property that is set to `true` when the node is being scaled
- Scaling mode is activated when:
  1. Shift key is held down
  2. Mouse is pressed on a selected node
  3. Mouse is dragged outside the node's boundary
- The `isScaling` state is properly managed throughout the drag lifecycle

### Edge Creation Prevention Flow
1. **Mouse Move Detection**: InteractionManager detects mouse movement away from selected node
2. **Scaling Check**: Before starting edge creation, checks `selectedNode.isScaling`
3. **Early Return**: If node is scaling, edge creation is skipped with console warning
4. **State Machine**: DiagramStateManager also checks scaling state before processing edge creation events

### Temporary Edge Cleanup Flow
1. **Background Click**: InteractionManager detects background click
2. **State Machine**: DiagramStateManager handles `backgroundClicked` event
3. **Cleanup Action**: State machine triggers `removeTemporaryEdge` action
4. **Delegation**: DiagramStateManager delegates cleanup to InteractionManager
5. **Complete Removal**: InteractionManager removes temporary edge from DOM

### Testing
- Created comprehensive test files:
  - `test-comprehensive-edge-fixes.html` - Tests both fixes together
  - `test-comprehensive-scaling-prevention.html` - Full system test with monitoring
  - `test-scaling-edge-prevention.html` - Simplified test for scaling prevention
  - `test-temporary-edge-sticking.html` - Specific test for the sticking issue
- All tests verify that both issues are resolved

## Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ **During Scaling**: No temporary edges should appear when mouse moves outside node boundaries
- ‚úÖ **After Scaling**: Temporary edges should work normally once scaling is complete
- ‚úÖ **Background Click**: Temporary edges should disappear immediately when background is clicked
- ‚úÖ **Escape Key**: Temporary edges should be cancelled when Escape is pressed
- ‚úÖ **Console Logging**: Clear warning messages when edge creation is blocked due to scaling

## Files Modified
1. `js/DiagramStateManager.js` - Added scaling check in `startEdgeCreation` and enhanced `removeTemporaryEdge`
2. `config/diagram-state-machine.json` - Updated state machine conditions
3. `test-comprehensive-edge-fixes.html` - Created comprehensive test for both fixes
4. `test-comprehensive-scaling-prevention.html` - Created full system test
5. `test-scaling-edge-prevention.html` - Created simplified scaling test
6. `test-temporary-edge-sticking.html` - Created specific sticking test

## Verification
The fixes ensure that:
1. **Scaling Prevention**: No temporary edges are created while a node is actively being scaled
2. **Proper Cleanup**: Temporary edges are immediately removed when background is clicked
3. **State Coordination**: Both InteractionManager and DiagramStateManager properly respect scaling mode
4. **State Machine Integration**: State machine configuration prevents edge creation during scaling
5. **Manager Coordination**: DiagramStateManager properly delegates cleanup to InteractionManager

These fixes maintain the integrity of both the scaling interaction and the edge creation workflow while ensuring proper cleanup and state management between the two systems.
